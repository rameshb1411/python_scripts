# High Level Design Documentation for Modem RF Testing

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level design overview of the test architecture and test cases implemented for the modem under test (DUT). The primary focus is on testing the RF functionalities of the modem, including frequency bands support, signal strength measurement, modulation and coding schemes, KPI testing, and RF driver testing. The modem supports both 4G and 5G technologies.

## 2. Test Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Simulators

#### 2.1.1 RAN Simulator
The RAN Simulator is designed to mimic the behavior of a real Radio Access Network (RAN). It supports multiple frequency bands, measures signal strength, and provides various modulation schemes.

#### 2.1.2 Modem Simulator
The Modem Simulator interacts with the RAN Simulator to check band support, measure signal strength, and retrieve modulation schemes. It acts as the Device Under Test (DUT) for the RF functionalities.

### 2.2 Integration with Robot Framework

The simulators are integrated with Robot Framework to automate the testing process. The `device_keywords.py` file contains the keywords used in the Robot Framework test cases. It handles device connections, command execution, and connection teardown.
